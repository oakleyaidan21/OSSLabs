## How to Answer Questions in a Helpful Way:
  - No matter how basic/simple the question seems, try to be as non-elitist as possible. Even if it's something like "How do I print 'hello world'?" you want to answer the question in a manner that would make whoever you're answering feel comfortable answering questions in the future. 
  - This is kinda a mix of both asking/answer questions in a helpful way, but if you yourself ask a question but figure out the solution before anyone answers, make sure to edit your post with your solution and not just "nvm I figured it out." 

## Free Culture

This chapter demonstrates the need for better literacy on software and fair-use rights. While I doubt those from the RIAA had/will ever get education on this topic, it's definitely possible to give people now a better base understanding of how much freedom someone has to do something like Jesse did. I'm not well-versed in copyright law pertaining to owning music on a computer, but if I'm not mistaken, I'm pretty sure that once you buy a song and download it to your computer, you now *own* that file. It certainly gets muddled when that song makes its way onto a public network, but I think that's still within legal limits. The RIAA probably only looked on the surface level: he made something that distributes music to others for free, which if done in real life, i.e. someone burned a album to CDs and sold those CDs, is illegal. Even if what Jesse did was actually illegal (which I don't know), the RIAA's treatement of an innocent college student was still appalling. This chapter also helpted me understand how explicit one needs to be about what they use in their software in order to avoid situations like these, which I'm sure will be detailed in this course. I imagine that the larger an open source project gets, the more complicated a legal altercation would be if it arose.

## Reflection

I've been eyeing **Musescore** lately. The description given on its github page is "MuseScore is an open source and free music notation software." I've used this program many times for fun and for work (I'm a music minor). One feature I always wished Musescore had was an option to show the musical interval between notes that are on the same beat, as it would help tremendously in writing multiple voice harmonies. I've done a bit of tinkering with editing and compiling the source code myself, but there are a lot of hiccups in the setup that make it a bit annoying.
