## 3. Why is it important to choose a LICENSE?

It is important to choose a license because it guarentees certain qualifications to the user of your program and makes sure it adheres to the criteria for free software that it outlines. This means that your software is developer friendly and more focused towards the community, which is something that open source projects should strive to nurture. 

## 4. Why is it important that you SHOULDN'T use a project that doesn't have an explicit license?

If you use or modify a project without an explicit license, this means that you are not given the freedoms that a licensed project has. Even if the project starts off as adhering to open source values, the owners could do something that doesn't follow these values, such as restricting access to past iterations of the project, obfuscating the source code, restricting certain features, etc. 

## 5. Read the Failure to follow the Open System Model Section of Why the Web beat Gopher. Do you agree with this claim? Write two to five sentences. 

I'm assuming its claim is the first sentence of the section, and I'd say I agree with this. Gopher made work harder for itself by not releasing early for others to help with, and after alienating the hacker community by requiring a licensing fee for .com domains, it didn't garner enough support from developers. After being forked too much and being late to the "internet standards game", HTTP became much more popular.
