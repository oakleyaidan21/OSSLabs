Comparing my own findings with those found with gitstats, there are a few discrepancies. The number of lines of code differ, where the gitstats version reports 525497. It also reports that there are 17 contributors, even though the github page only says there are 13. This might be due to conntributors leaving the project, but I'm not sure.
